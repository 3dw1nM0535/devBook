## Installation guide

So you are interested in working with the best event management platform on the planet earth, this will be your guideline on how to install the App and interact with it locally on your local machine.

If you feel like there is a feature you want to contribute to or add a new feature to the platform:

```
git clone <repo> && cd event
```

Once in the event folder:

```
sudo npm install
```
to install all the necessary dependencies packages.

You'll need to configure your own private keys in the `.env` file before you start building and before you start the development server

Run

```
npm run build
```
to build your own local build development version of the App then run

```
npm start
```
to start the development server.

Its time now to get started with the App.
